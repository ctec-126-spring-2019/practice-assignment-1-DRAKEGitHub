                <p>
                    My name is Allison Drake and I am in my last term at Clark College to complete my AAT in Web
                    Development. I love coding, but I love designing products and programs that fit the user needs a lot
                    more. There's something about the design and planning process, both for visual and data purposes,
                    that I find fascinating.
                    <br><br>
                    I call myself a maker, because I enjoy making things. Whether it's websites, products, art, music,
                    structures, sewn goods, plants, programs, food, crafts, love; making things brings me joy.

                <p>
                    My goal for this class are to get a really good understanding of how JavaScript works and how I can
                    better
                    utilize it in my work.
                </p>

                <h2 class="card-title">Programming Skills and Languages</h2>
                <p>
                    My programming skills are strong for a newbie and I feel confident that I'll just grow with time and
                    the right experience. I can figure most things out with time but I definitely rely
                    upon
                    research and do not have it down to an intuitive level for some languages.

                    <li class="list-group-item text-uppercase">Languages I Know:</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">HTML and CSS</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">C# and .NET</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Python</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">PHP</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I enjoy using HTML and CSS because I'm always surprised at what they can do on their own without any
                    added
                    help.
                    I like Python for automation and coding engineering based applications.
                    I like PHP for what it can do with HTML and CSS.
                    <br>
                    C# exists. I have no feelings for it.
